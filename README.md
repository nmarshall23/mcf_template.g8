mcf_template.g8
===============

A Scala giter8, Minecraft Forge Template 

You will need to install giter8, see https://github.com/n8han/giter8#readme

Then it's very easy run: 

g8 nmarshall23/mcf_template.g8

Answer some questions, and your mod's scaffolding is ready.

This template uses Ant, and not SBT to compile and build jar's. I would like to use SBT. However Buildcraft's Ant file is good enough. It does take care of the hard work, of downloading MCP, setting up forge, and auto decompiles minecraft.  See BuildCraft's repo, https://github.com/BuildCraft/BuildCraft
